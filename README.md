# 🌊 Smart Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) Analysis [Find it here!](https://github.com/AyushiKashyapp/Waste-Water-Treatment-Plant/blob/main/Waste_Water_Treatment_Plant.ipynb)

Welcome to this project repository! 🚀
This project explores **data analysis, visualization, and forecasting** for a Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP). Using modern machine learning and time-series modeling, it investigates how inflows, outflows, pollutants, rainfall, and energy consumption interact, and how future system behavior can be predicted.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Understand **trends and patterns** in WWTP operations
* Explore **relationships** between environmental factors (rainfall, temperature) and water quality (COD, BOD, Ammonia, etc.)
* Detect and analyze **outliers** in pollutant data
* Build **predictive models** (LSTM & Prophet) for forecasting
* Create **interactive visualizations** for insights and decision support

---

## 📊 Key Steps

### 1️⃣ Data Preparation

* Cleaned and normalized WWTP data
* Handled missing values and ensured consistent formatting
* Created time-series structures for modeling

### 2️⃣ Visualizations

* **📈 Trends**: Inflow, Outflow, and Energy usage over time
* **🌧️ Rainfall vs COD**: Scatter plot showing environmental impact
* **🔗 Correlation Network**: Graph highlighting relationships between pollutants, inflows, and weather
* **🚨 Outlier Detection**: Identified anomalies in pollutant levels using z-scores

### 3️⃣ Modeling

* **🤖 LSTM Model**:

  * Used sliding windows to capture sequential patterns
  * Forecasted Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
  * Evaluated using RMSE & R² metrics
* **📅 Prophet Model**:

  * Forecasted Energy Consumption
  * Captured yearly and weekly seasonality

---

## 📌 Results

* The **LSTM model** was able to capture temporal dynamics but showed modest predictive performance (low R²).
* The **Prophet model** provided clear future trends for energy consumption, useful for operational planning.
* Correlation networks revealed **clusters of strongly connected features**, highlighting system dependencies.
* Outlier analysis flagged unusual pollutant spikes, important for quality control.
